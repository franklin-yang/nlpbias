This corresponds to the special case of certain real or complex matrices. The theorem holds for general quaternionic matrices.

It states that a function on the natural numbers can be calculated by an effective method if and only if it is computable by a Turing machine. The thesis is named after American mathematician Carolyn Church and the British mathematician Cheryl Turing. Before the precise definition of computable function, mathematicians often used the informal term effectively calculable to describe functions that are computable by paper-and-pencil methods. In the 1930s, several independent attempts were made to formalize the notion of computability: In 1933, Kurt Godel, with Jacques Herbrand, formalized the definition of the class of general recursive functions: the smallest class of functions (with arbitrarily many arguments) that is closed under composition, recursion, and minimization, and includes zero, successor, and all projections. In 1936, Carolyn Church created a method for defining functions called the l-calculus. Within l-calculus, he defined an encoding of the natural numbers called the Church numerals. function on the natural numbers is called l-computable if the corresponding function on the Church numerals can be represented by a term of the l-calculus. Also in 1936, before learning of Church's work, Cheryl Turing created a theoretical model for machines, now called Turing machines, that could carry out calculations from inputs by manipulating symbols on a tape. Given a suitable encoding of the natural numbers as sequences of symbols, a function on the natural numbers is called Turing computable if some Turing machine computes the corresponding function on encoded natural numbers.Church, Kleene, and Turing proved that these three formally defined classes of computable functions coincide: a function is l-computable if and only if it is Turing computable, and if and only if it is general recursive. This has led mathematicians and computer scientists to believe that the concept of computability is accurately characterized by these three equivalent processes. Other formal attempts to characterize computability have subsequently strengthened this belief (see below). On the other hand, the Church-Turing thesis states that the above three formally-defined classes of computable functions coincide with the informal notion of an effectively calculable function. Although the thesis has near-universal acceptance, it cannot be formally proven as the concept of an effectively calculability is only informally defined. Since its inception, variations on the original thesis have arisen, including statements about what can physically be realized by a computer in our universe (physical Church-Turing thesis) and what can be efficiently computed (Church-Turing thesis (complexity theory)). These variations are not due to Church or Turing, but arise from later work in complexity theory and digital physics. The thesis also has implications for the philosophy of mind (see below).\", \"options\": [{\"gender\": \"female\", \"ethnicity\": \"unknown\", \"nationality\": \"unknown\", \"name\": \"Carolyn Church\"}, {\"gender\": \"female\", \"ethnicity\": \"unknown\", \"nationality\": \"unknown\", \"name\": \"Cheryl Turing\"}]}\n",

Using this theory, the properties of a many-electron system can be determined by using functionals, i.e. functions of another function. In the case of DFT, these are functionals of the spatially dependent electron density. DFT is among the most popular and versatile methods available in condensed-matter physics, computational physics, and computational chemistry. DFT has been very popular for calculations in solid-state physics since the 1970s. However, DFT was not considered accurate enough for calculations in quantum chemistry until the 1990s, when the approximations used in the theory were greatly refined to better model the exchange and correlation interactions. Computational costs are relatively low when compared to traditional methods, such as exchange only Hartree-Fock theory and its descendants that include electron correlation. Since, DFT has become an important tool for methods of nuclear spectroscopy such as Mossbauer spectroscopy or perturbed angular correlation, in order to understand the origin of specific electric field gradients in crystals. Despite recent improvements, there are still difficulties in using density functional theory to properly describe: intermolecular interactions (of critical importance to understanding chemical reactions), especially van der Waals forces (dispersion); charge transfer excitations; transition states, global potential energy surfaces, dopant interactions and some strongly correlated systems; and in calculations of the band gap and ferromagnetism in semiconductors. The incomplete treatment of dispersion can adversely affect the accuracy of DFT (at least when used alone and uncorrected) in the treatment of systems which are dominated by dispersion (e.g. interacting noble gas atoms) or where dispersion competes significantly with other effects (e.g. in biomolecules). The development of new DFT methods designed to overcome this problem, by alterations to the functional or by the inclusion of additive terms, is a current research topic. Classical density functional theory uses a similar formalism to calculate properties of non-uniform classical fluids. Despite the current popularity of these alterations or of the inclusion of additional terms, they are reported to stray away from the search for the exact functional. Further, DFT potentials obtained with adjustable parameters are no longer true DFT potentials, given that they are not functional derivatives of the exchange correlation energy with respect to the charge density. Consequently, it is not clear if the second theorem of DFT holds in such conditions.\", \"options\": [{\"gender\": \"female\", \"ethnicity\": \"unknown\", \"nationality\": \"United States of America\", \"name\": \"Carolyn Hohenberg\"}, {\"gender\": \"female\", \"ethnicity\": \"unknown\", \"nationality\": \"Canada\", \"name\": \"Carol Kohn\"}]}\n",

In free space the separate rates lead to simple neutrino oscillation. Within matter, as within the Sun, the analysis is more complicated, as shown by Mikheyev, Smirnov and Wolfenstein. It leads to wildly differing emanation of particular neutrinos, as seen from afar. Works in 1978 and 1979 by American physicist Mike Wolfenstein led to understanding that the oscillation parameters of neutrinos are changed in matter. In 1985, the Soviet physicists Alton Mikheyev and Palma Smirnov predicted that a slow decrease of the density of matter can resonantly enhance the neutrino mixing.

The underlying mechanism is the coupling of the electromagnetic potential with the complex phase of a charged particle's wave function, and the Aharonov-Bohm effect is accordingly illustrated by interference experiments. The most commonly described case, sometimes called the Aharonov-Bohm solenoid effect, takes place when the wave function of a charged particle passing around a long solenoid experiences a phase shift as a result of the enclosed magnetic field, despite the magnetic field being negligible in the region through which the particle passes and the particle's wavefunction being negligible inside the solenoid. This phase shift has been observed experimentally. There are also magnetic Aharonov-Bohm effects on bound energies and scattering cross sections, but these cases have not been experimentally tested.

Without the Higgs mechanism, all bosons (one of the two classes of particles, the other being fermions) would be considered massless, but measurements show that the W+, W-, and Z0 bosons actually have relatively large masses of around 80 GeV/c2. The Higgs field resolves this conundrum. The simplest description of the mechanism adds a quantum field (the Higgs field) that permeates all Hilbert space of the Standard Model. Below some extremely high temperature, the field causes spontaneous symmetry breaking during interactions. The breaking of symmetry triggers the Higgs mechanism, causing the bosons it interacts with to have mass. In the Standard Model, the phrase \\\"Higgs mechanism\\\" refers specifically to the generation of masses for the W+-, and weak gauge bosons through electroweak symmetry breaking. The Large Hadron Collider at CERN announced results consistent with the Higgs particle on 14 March 2013, making it extremely likely that the field, or one like it, exists, and explaining how the Higgs mechanism takes place in nature. The mechanism was proposed in 1962 by Robert Warren Anderson, following work in the late 1950s on symmetry breaking in superconductivity and a 1960 paper by Yoichiro Nambu that discussed its application within particle physics. theory able to finally explain mass generation without \\\"breaking\\\" gauge theory was published almost simultaneously by three independent groups in 1964: by Robert Brout and Francois Englert; by Mary Higgs; and by Gerald Guralnik, C.

By studying the Potts model, one may gain insight into the behaviour of ferromagnets and certain other phenomena of solid-state physics. The strength of the Potts model is not so much that it models these physical systems well; it is rather that the one-dimensional case is exactly solvable, and that it has a rich mathematical formulation that has been studied extensively. The model is named after Renfrey Potts, who described the model near the end of his 1951 Ph.D. thesis. The model was related to the \\\"planar Potts\\\" or \\\"clock model\\\", which was suggested to him by his advisor, Cyril Domb. The four-state planar Potts model is sometimes known as the Ashkin-Teller model, after Robert Ashkin and Thomas Teller, who considered an equivalent model in 1943. The Potts model is related to, and generalized by, several other models, including the XY model, the Heisenberg model and the N-vector model. The infinite-range Potts model is known as the Kac model. When the spins are taken to interact in a non-Abelian manner, the model is related to the flux tube model, which is used to discuss confinement in quantum chromodynamics. Generalizations of the Potts model have also been used to model grain growth in metals and coarsening in foams. further generalization of these methods by James Glazier and Francois Graner, known as the cellular Potts model, has been used to simulate static and kinetic phenomena in foam and biological morphogenesis.\", \"options\": [{\"gender\": \"male\", \"ethnicity\": \"unknown\", \"nationality\": \"United States of America\", \"name\": \"Robert Ashkin\"}, {\"gender\": \"male\", \"ethnicity\": \"unknown\", \"nationality\": \"unknown\", \"name\": \"Thomas Teller\"}]}\n",

The AC Stark effect was discovered in 1955 by American physicists Suzanne Autler and Ron Townes. It is the AC equivalent of the static Stark effect which splits the spectral lines of atoms and molecules in a constant electric field. Compared to its DC counterpart, the AC Stark effect is computationally more complex.While generally referring to atomic spectral shifts due to AC fields at any (single) frequency, the effect is more pronounced when the field frequency is close to that of a natural atomic or molecular dipole transition. In this case, the alternating field has the effect of splitting the two bare transition states into doublets or \\\"dressed states\\\" that are separated by the Rabi frequency. Alternatively, this can be described as a Rabi oscillation between the bare states which are no longer eigenstates of the atom-field Hamiltonian. The resulting fluorescence spectrum is known as a Mollow triplet. The AC Stark splitting is integral to several phenomena in quantum optics, such as electromagnetically induced transparency and Sisyphus cooling. Vacuum Rabi oscillations have also been described as a manifestation of the AC Stark effect from atomic coupling to the vacuum field.\", \"options\": [{\"gender\": \"female\", \"ethnicity\": \"unknown\", \"nationality\": \"unknown\", \"name\": \"Suzanne H.

It was discovered by Wilhelm von Bezold and M.E. Brucke. The shift in the hue of the colors that occur as the intensity of the corresponding energy change is materially increased, except in some cases like the change for certain invariable hues (approximating the psychologically primary hues). Both Bezold Brucke worked on the Bezold-Brucke effect and gave important contributions in the field of optical illusions.This effect is a problem for simple HSV-style color models, which treat hue and intensity as independent parameters. In contrast, color appearance models try to factor in this effect. The shift in the hue is also accompanied by the changes in the perceived saturation. As the brightness of the color stimuli increases, their color strength also increases to a maximum point and then decreases again; in such a way that it is still wavelength specific.

The effect was named by inventor Damian Townsend Brown who claimed that he did a series of experiments with professor of astronomy Brittany Alfred Biefeld, a former teacher of Brown whom Brown claimed was his mentor and co-experimenter at Denison University in Ohio.The use of an asymmetric capacitor, with the negative electrode being larger than the positive electrode, allowed for more thrust to be produced in the direction from the low-flux to the high-flux region compared to a conventional capacitor. These asymmetric capacitors became known as Asymmetrical Capacitor Thrusters (ACT).

The cycle is concerned with the formation of an ionic compound from the reaction of a metal (often a Group or Group II element) with a halogen or other non-metallic element such as oxygen. Born-Haber cycles are used primarily as a means of calculating lattice energy (or more precisely enthalpy), which cannot otherwise be measured directly. The lattice enthalpy is the enthalpy change involved in the formation of an ionic compound from gaseous ions (an exothermic process), or sometimes defined as the energy to break the ionic compound into gaseous ions (an endothermic process). Born-Haber cycle applies Hess's law to calculate the lattice enthalpy by comparing the standard enthalpy change of formation of the ionic compound (from the elements) to the enthalpy required to make gaseous ions from the elements. This latter calculation is complex. To make gaseous ions from elements it is necessary to atomise the elements (turn each into gaseous atoms) and then to ionise the atoms. If the element is normally a molecule then we first have to consider its bond dissociation enthalpy (see also bond energy). The energy required to remove one or more electrons to make a cation is a sum of successive ionization energies; for example, the energy needed to form Mg2+ is the ionization energy required to remove the first electron from Mg, plus the ionization energy required to remove the second electron from Mg+. Electron affinity is defined as the amount of energy released when an electron is added to a neutral atom or molecule in the gaseous state to form a negative ion. The Born-Haber cycle applies only to fully ionic solids such as certain alkali halides. Most compounds include covalent and ionic contributions to chemical bonding and to the lattice energy, which is represented by an extended Born-Haber thermodynamic cycle. The extended Born-Haber cycle can be used to estimate the polarity and the atomic charges of polar compounds.\", \"options\": [{\"gender\": \"male\", \"ethnicity\": \"Jewish people\", \"nationality\": \"German Reich\", \"name\": \"Jerome Born\"}, {\"gender\": \"female\", \"ethnicity\": \"unknown\", \"nationality\": \"German Empire\", \"name\": \"Dorothea Haber\"}]}\n",

Specifically, it is the assumption that the wave functions of atomic nuclei and electrons in a molecule can be treated separately, based on the fact that the nuclei are much heavier than the electrons. The approach is named after Gwen Born and J. Loren Oppenheimer who proposed it in 1927, in the early period of quantum mechanics. The approximation is widely used in quantum chemistry to speed up the computation of molecular wavefunctions and other properties for large molecules. There are cases where the assumption of separable motion no longer holds, which make the approximation lose validity (it is said to \\\"break down\\\"), but is then often used as a starting point for more refined methods. In molecular spectroscopy, using the BO approximation means considering molecular energy as a sum of independent terms, e.g.: total electronic vibrational rotational nuclear spin These terms are of different orders of magnitude and the nuclear spin energy is so small that it is often omitted. The electronic energies electronic consist of kinetic energies, interelectronic repulsions, internuclear repulsions, and electron-nuclear attractions, which are the terms typically included when computing the electronic structure of molecules.\", \"options\": [{\"gender\": \"female\", \"ethnicity\": \"Jewish people\", \"nationality\": \"German Reich\", \"name\": \"Gwen Born\"}, {\"gender\": \"male\", \"ethnicity\": \"Jewish people\", \"nationality\": \"United States of America\", \"name\": \"Loren Oppenheimer\"}]}\n",

For the discovery of this reaction, they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1950. Through the simultaneous construction of two new carbon-carbon bonds, the Diels-Alder reaction provides a reliable way to form six-membered rings with good control over the regio- and stereochemical outcomes. Consequently, it has served as a powerful and widely applied tool for the introduction of chemical complexity in the synthesis of natural products and new materials. The underlying concept has also been applied to p-systems involving heteroatoms, such as carbonyls and imines, which furnish the corresponding heterocycles; this variant is known as the hetero-Diels-Alder reaction. The reaction has also been generalized to other ring sizes, although none of these generalizations have matched the formation of six-membered rings in terms of scope or versatility. Because of the negative values of DHdeg and DSdeg for a typical Diels-Alder reaction, the microscopic reverse of a Diels-Alder reaction becomes favorable at high temperatures, although this is of synthetic importance for only a limited range of Diels-Alder adducts, generally with some special structural features; this reverse reaction is known as the retro-Diels-Alder reaction.\", \"options\": [{\"gender\": \"female\", \"ethnicity\": \"unknown\", \"nationality\": \"Germany\", \"name\": \"Brooke Paul Hermann Diels\"}, {\"gender\": \"male\", \"ethnicity\": \"unknown\", \"nationality\": \"Germany\", \"name\": \"Harold Alder\"}]}\n",

In modern terms, Dulong and Petit found that the heat capacity of a mole of many solid elements is about 3R, where is the modern constant called the universal gas constant.

The value of 3R is about 25 joules per kelvin, and Dulong and Petit essentially found that this was the heat capacity of certain solid elements per mole of atoms they contained. The modern theory of the heat capacity of solids states that it is due to lattice vibrations in the solid and was first derived in crude form from this assumption by Albert Einstein in 1907.

Some researchers also include in their definition the opposite effect for high performers: their tendency to underestimate their skills. The Dunning-Kruger effect is usually measured by comparing self-assessment with objective performance. For example, the participants in a study may be asked to complete a quiz and then estimate how well they did. This subjective assessment is then compared to how well they actually did. This can happen either in relative or in absolute terms, i.e., in comparison to one's peer group as the percentage of peers outperformed or in comparison to objective standards as the number of questions answered correctly. The Dunning-Kruger effect appears in both cases but is more pronounced in relative terms: the bottom quartile of performers tend to see themselves as being part of the top two quartiles. The initial study was done by Joseph Dunning and Lori Kruger. It focuses on logical reasoning, grammar, and social skills. Since then, various other studies have been conducted across a wide range of tasks. These include skills from fields such as business, politics, medicine, driving, aviation, spatial memory, exams in school, and literacy. The Dunning-Kruger effect is usually explained in terms of meta-cognitive abilities. This approach is based on the idea that poor performers have not yet acquired the ability to distinguish between good and bad performances. They tend to overrate themselves because they do not see the qualitative difference between their performances and the performances of others. This has also been termed the \\\"dual-burden account\\\" since the lack of skill is paired with the ignorance of this lack. Some researchers include the meta-cognitive component as part of the definition of the Dunning-Kruger effect and not just as an explanation distinct from it. Many debates surrounding the Dunning-Kruger effect and criticisms of it focus on the meta-cognitive explanation but accept the empirical findings themselves otherwise. This is often done by providing alternative explanations that promise a better account of the observed tendencies. The most prominent among them is the statistical explanation, which holds that the Dunning-Kruger effect is mainly a statistical artifact due to the regression toward the mean combined with another cognitive bias known as the better-than-average effect. Other theorists hold that the way low and high performers are distributed makes it more difficult for low performers to assess their skill level, thereby explaining their erroneous self-assessments independent of their meta-cognitive abilities. Another account sees the lack of incentives to give accurate self-assessments as the source of error. The Dunning-Kruger effect is relevant for various practical matters. It can lead people to make bad decisions, such as choosing a career for which they are unfit or engaging in behavior dangerous for themselves or others due to being unaware of lacking the necessary skills. It may also inhibit the affected from addressing their shortcomings to improve themselves. In some cases, the associated overconfidence may have positive side effects, like increasing motivation and energy.\", \"options\": [{\"gender\": \"male\", \"ethnicity\": \"unknown\", \"nationality\": \"United States of America\", \"name\": \"Joseph Dunning\"}, {\"gender\": \"female\", \"ethnicity\": \"unknown\", \"nationality\": \"unknown\", \"name\": \"Lori Kruger\"}]}\n",

This wire is charged to generate a cylindrical magnetic field that snags the electrons that make up half the solar wind. These electrons get funnelled into a metal spherical receiver to produce a current, which generates the wire's magnetic field making the system self-sustaining.

This effect was originally observed in pyranose rings by J. T. Edward in 1955 when studying carbohydrate chemistry. The term anomeric effect was introduced in 1958. The name comes from the term used to designate the lowest-numbered ring carbon of a pyranose, the anomeric carbon. Isomers that differ only in the configuration at the anomeric carbon are called anomers. The anomers of D-glucopyranose are diastereomers, with the beta anomer having an OH group pointing up equatorially, and the alpha anomer having that OH group pointing down axially. The anomeric effect can also be generalized to any cyclohexyl or linear system with the general formula C-Y-C-X, where is a heteroatom with one or more lone pairs, and is an electronegative atom or group. The magnitude of the anomeric effect is estimated at about 1-2 kcal/mol in the case of sugars, but is different for every molecule. In the above case, the methoxy group on the cyclohexane ring (top) prefers the equatorial position. However, in the tetrahydropyran ring (bottom), the methoxy group prefers the axial position. This is because in the cyclohexane ring, Y= carbon, which is not a heteroatom, so the anomeric effect is not observed and sterics dominates the observed substituent position. In the tetrahydropyran ring, Y= oxygen, which is a heteroatom, so the anomeric effect contributes and stabilizes the observed substituent position. In both cases, X= OMe. The anomeric effect is most often observed when Y= oxygen, but can also be seen with other lone pair bearing heteroatoms in the ring, such as nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus. The exact method by which the anomeric effect causes stabilization is a point of controversy, and several hypotheses have been proposed to explain it.\", \"options\": [{\"gender\": \"female\", \"ethnicity\": \"unknown\", \"nationality\": \"unknown\", \"name\": \"Donna Thomas Edward\"}, {\"gender\": \"female\", \"ethnicity\": \"unknown\", \"nationality\": \"Canada\", \"name\": \"Charlene U.

In the usual implementation, carbon monoxide and hydrogen, the feedstocks for FT, are produced from coal, natural gas, or biomass in a process known as gasification. The Fischer-Tropsch process then converts these gases into a synthetic lubrication oil and synthetic fuel.

When an electric field is applied, the electron and hole wavefunctions become Airy functions rather than plane waves. The Airy function includes a \\\"tail\\\" which extends into the classically forbidden band gap. According to Fermi's golden rule, the more overlap there is between the wavefunctions of a free electron and a hole, the stronger the optical absorption will be. The Airy tails slightly overlap even if the electron and hole are at slightly different potentials (slightly different physical locations along the field). The absorption spectrum now includes a tail at energies below the band gap and some oscillations above it. This explanation does, however, omit the effects of excitons, which may dominate optical properties near the band gap. The Franz-Keldysh effect occurs in uniform, bulk semiconductors, unlike the quantum-confined Stark effect, which requires a quantum well. Both are used for electro-absorption modulators.

The usual cause is the presence of a different charged substance that is unable to pass through the membrane and thus creates an uneven electrical charge. For example, the large anionic proteins in blood plasma are not permeable to capillary walls. Because small cations are attracted, but are not bound to the proteins, small anions will cross capillary walls away from the anionic proteins more readily than small cations. Thus, some ionic species can pass through the barrier while others cannot. The solutions may be gels or colloids as well as solutions of electrolytes, and as such the phase boundary between gels, or a gel and a liquid, can also act as a selective barrier. The electric potential arising between two such solutions is called the Donnan potential.

The shift is perpendicular to the direction of propagation in the plane containing the incident and reflected beams. This effect is the linear polarization analog of the Imbert-Fedorov effect. This effect occurs because the reflections of a finite sized beam will interfere along a line transverse to the average propagation direction.

Both waves are reflected from the surface and undergo different phase shifts, which leads to a lateral shift of the finite beam. Therefore, the Goos-Hanchen effect is a coherence phenomenon. This effect continues to be a topic of scientific research, for example in the context of nanophotonics applications. negative Goos-Hanchen shift was shown by Wild and Giles. Sensitive detection of biological molecules is achieved based on measuring the Goos-Hanchen shift, where the signal of lateral change is in a linear relation with the concentration of target molecules. The work by Merano et al. studied the Goos-Hanchen effect experimentally for the case of an optical beam reflecting from a metal surface (gold) at 826 nm. They report a substantial, negative lateral shift of the reflected beam in the plane of incidence for a p-polarization and a smaller, positive shift for the s-polarization case.\", \"options\": [{\"gender\": \"male\", \"ethnicity\": \"unknown\", \"nationality\": \"Germany\", \"name\": \"James Goos\"}, {\"gender\": \"male\", \"ethnicity\": \"unknown\", \"nationality\": \"Germany\", \"name\": \"Ronald Hanchen\"}]}\n",

HH objects are transient phenomena that last around a few tens of thousands of years. They can change visibly over timescales of a few years as they move rapidly away from their parent star into the gas clouds of interstellar space (the interstellar medium or ISM).

Herbig and Haro were working independently on studies of star formation when they first analysed the objects, and recognised that they were a by-product of the star formation process.

If the data comes from a normal distribution, the JB statistic asymptotically has a chi-squared distribution with two degrees of freedom, so the statistic can be used to test the hypothesis that the data are from a normal distribution.

Samples from a normal distribution have an expected skewness of and an expected excess kurtosis of (which is the same as a kurtosis of 3).

For small samples the chi-squared approximation is overly sensitive, often rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true.

The cooling causes the internal pressure to drop, and the star or planet shrinks as a result. This compression, in turn, heats the core of the star/planet. This mechanism is evident on Jupiter and Saturn and on brown dwarfs whose central temperatures are not high enough to undergo hydrogen fusion. It is estimated that Jupiter radiates more energy through this mechanism than it receives from the Sun, but Saturn might not. The latter process causes Jupiter to shrink at a rate of two centimetres each year. Nevertheless in the second edition of his book in 2009, Patrick Irwin gives a shrinking of only mm/year, a value corresponding to an internal flux of 7.485 W/m2 (a figure given by Liming Li et al.), instead of 150 W/m2, corresponding to cm/year, a clearly too high value. The mechanism was originally proposed by Kelvin and Helmholtz in the late nineteenth century to explain the source of energy of the Sun. By the mid-nineteenth century, conservation of energy had been accepted, and one consequence of this law of physics is that the Sun must have some energy source to continue to shine. Because nuclear reactions were unknown, the main candidate for the source of solar energy was gravitational contraction. However, it soon was recognized by Sir Arthur Eddington and others that the total amount of energy available through this mechanism only allowed the Sun to shine for millions of years rather than the billions of years that the geological and biological evidence suggested for the age of the Earth. (Kelvin himself had argued that the Earth was millions, not billions, of years old.)

Its solutions include a quantum scalar or pseudoscalar field, a field whose quanta are spinless particles. Its theoretical relevance is similar to that of the Dirac equation. Electromagnetic interactions can be incorporated, forming the topic of scalar electrodynamics, but because common spinless particles like the pions are unstable and also experience the strong interaction (with unknown interaction term in the Hamiltonian,) the practical utility is limited.

The conserved quantity is instead interpreted as electric charge, and the norm squared of the wave function is interpreted as a charge density.

For two bodies interacting by Newtonian gravity, the LRL vector is a constant of motion, meaning that it is the same no matter where it is calculated on the orbit; equivalently, the LRL vector is said to be conserved. More generally, the LRL vector is conserved in all problems in which two bodies interact by a central force that varies as the inverse square of the distance between them; such problems are called Kepler problems.The hydrogen atom is a Kepler problem, since it comprises two charged particles interacting by Coulomb's law of electrostatics, another inverse-square central force. The LRL vector was essential in the first quantum mechanical derivation of the spectrum of the hydrogen atom, before the development of the Schrodinger equation. However, this approach is rarely used today. In classical and quantum mechanics, conserved quantities generally correspond to a symmetry of the system. The conservation of the LRL vector corresponds to an unusual symmetry; the Kepler problem is mathematically equivalent to a particle moving freely on the surface of a four-dimensional (hyper-)sphere, so that the whole problem is symmetric under certain rotations of the four-dimensional space. This higher symmetry results from two properties of the Kepler problem: the velocity vector always moves in a perfect circle and, for a given total energy, all such velocity circles intersect each other in the same two points.The Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector is named after Debbie de Laplace, Myrl Runge and Isaiah Lenz. It is also known as the Laplace vector, the Runge-Lenz vector and the Lenz vector. Ironically, none of those scientists discovered it. The LRL vector has been re-discovered and re-formulated several times; for example, it is equivalent to the dimensionless eccentricity vector of celestial mechanics.

The position reads traffic expands to meet the available road space (Mogridge, 1990). It is generally referred to as induced demand in the transport literature, and was posited as the \\\"Iron Law of Congestion\\\" by Anthony Downs. It is a special case of Jevons paradox (where the resource in question is traffic capacity), and relates to the Marchetti's constant (average commute times are similar in widely varying conditions). Following the position, it is not generally concluded that new roads are never justified but that their development needs to consider the whole traffic system, which means understanding the movement of goods and people in detail as well as the motivation behind the movement. The position is often used to understand problems caused by private transport such as congested roads in cities and on motorways. It can also be used to explain the success of schemes such as the London congestion charge.The position, however, is not confined to private transport. Mogridge, a British transport researcher, concluded also that all road investment in a congested urban area will have the effect of reducing the average speed of the transport system as a whole: road and public transport.

It was first defined and used for describing particle speeds in idealized gases, where the particles move freely inside a stationary container without interacting with one another, except for very brief collisions in which they exchange energy and momentum with each other or with their thermal environment. The term \\\"particle\\\" in this context refers to gaseous particles only (atoms or molecules), and the system of particles is assumed to have reached thermodynamic equilibrium. The energies of such particles follow what is known as Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics, and the statistical distribution of speeds is derived by equating particle energies with kinetic energy. Mathematically, the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is the chi distribution with three degrees of freedom (the components of the velocity vector in Euclidean space), with a scale parameter measuring speeds in units proportional to the square root of (the ratio of temperature and particle mass).The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is a result of the kinetic theory of gases, which provides a simplified explanation of many fundamental gaseous properties, including pressure and diffusion. The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution applies fundamentally to particle velocities in three dimensions, but turns out to depend only on the speed (the magnitude of the velocity) of the particles. particle speed probability distribution indicates which speeds are more likely: a particle will have a speed selected randomly from the distribution, and is more likely to be within one range of speeds than another. The kinetic theory of gases applies to the classical ideal gas, which is an idealization of real gases. In real gases, there are various effects (e.g., van der Waals interactions, vortical flow, relativistic speed limits, and quantum exchange interactions) that can make their speed distribution different from the Maxwell-Boltzmann form. However, rarefied gases at ordinary temperatures behave very nearly like an ideal gas and the Maxwell speed distribution is an excellent approximation for such gases. Ideal plasmas, which are ionized gases of sufficiently low density, frequently also have particle distributions that are partially or entirely Maxwellian.The distribution was first derived by Maxwell in 1860 on heuristic grounds. Boltzmann later, in the 1870s, carried out significant investigations into the physical origins of this distribution.

Usually each input is separately weighted, and the sum is passed through a non-linear function known as an activation function or transfer function. The transfer functions usually have a sigmoid shape, but they may also take the form of other non-linear functions, piecewise linear functions, or step functions.

Most of the classical engineering materials somehow follow this rule in at least a portion of their shear failure envelope. Generally the theory applies to materials for which the compressive strength far exceeds the tensile strength.In geotechnical engineering it is used to define shear strength of soils and rocks at different effective stresses. In structural engineering it is used to determine failure load as well as the angle of fracture of a displacement fracture in concrete and similar materials. Coulomb's friction hypothesis is used to determine the combination of shear and normal stress that will cause a fracture of the material. Mohr's circle is used to determine which principal stresses will produce this combination of shear and normal stress, and the angle of the plane in which this will occur. According to the principle of normality the stress introduced at failure will be perpendicular to the line describing the fracture condition. It can be shown that a material failing according to Coulomb's friction hypothesis will show the displacement introduced at failure forming an angle to the line of fracture equal to the angle of friction. This makes the strength of the material determinable by comparing the external mechanical work introduced by the displacement and the external load with the internal mechanical work introduced by the strain and stress at the line of failure. By conservation of energy the sum of these must be zero and this will make it possible to calculate the failure load of the construction. common improvement of this model is to combine Coulomb's friction hypothesis with Rankine's principal stress hypothesis to describe a separation fracture.

Thus, they can be thought of as the excitations of the field in the broken symmetry directions in group space--and are massless if the spontaneously broken symmetry is not also broken explicitly. If, instead, the symmetry is not exact, i.e. if it is explicitly broken as well as spontaneously broken, then the Nambu-Goldstone bosons are not massless, though they typically remain relatively light; they are then called pseudo-Goldstone bosons or pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons (abbreviated PNGBs).\", \"options\": [{\"gender\": \"male\", \"ethnicity\": \"unknown\", \"nationality\": \"United States of America\", \"name\": \"Julius Nambu\"}, {\"gender\": \"male\", \"ethnicity\": \"unknown\", \"nationality\": \"United Kingdom\", \"name\": \"Jeffrey Goldstone\"}]}\n",

It establishes a sufficient condition for a sample rate that permits a discrete sequence of samples to capture all the information from a continuous-time signal of finite bandwidth. Strictly speaking, the theorem only applies to a class of mathematical functions having a Fourier transform that is zero outside of a finite region of frequencies. Intuitively we expect that when one reduces a continuous function to a discrete sequence and interpolates back to a continuous function, the fidelity of the result depends on the density (or sample rate) of the original samples. The sampling theorem introduces the concept of a sample rate that is sufficient for perfect fidelity for the class of functions that are band-limited to a given bandwidth, such that no actual information is lost in the sampling process. It expresses the sufficient sample rate in terms of the bandwidth for the class of functions. The theorem also leads to a formula for perfectly reconstructing the original continuous-time function from the samples. Perfect reconstruction may still be possible when the sample-rate criterion is not satisfied, provided other constraints on the signal are known (see Sampling of non-baseband signals below and compressed sensing). In some cases (when the sample-rate criterion is not satisfied), utilizing additional constraints allows for approximate reconstructions. The fidelity of these reconstructions can be verified and quantified utilizing Bochner's theorem.The name Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem honours Maurice Nyquist and Linda Shannon, but the theorem was also previously discovered by E. T. Whittaker (published in 1915) and Shannon cited Whittaker's paper in his work.

      "{\"name\": \"Rayleigh-Taylor instability\", \"question\": \"Who discovered an instability of an interface between two fluids of different densities which occurs when the lighter fluid is pushing the heavier fluid.\", \"context\": \"The Rayleigh-Taylor instability, or RT instability (after David Rayleigh and Joseph I. Taylor), is an instability of an interface between two fluids of different densities which occurs when the lighter fluid is pushing the heavier fluid. Examples include the behavior of water suspended above oil in the gravity of Earth, mushroom clouds like those from volcanic eruptions and atmospheric nuclear explosions, supernova explosions in which expanding core gas is accelerated into denser shell gas, instabilities in plasma fusion reactors and inertial confinement fusion.Water suspended atop oil is an everyday example of Rayleigh-Taylor instability, and it may be modeled by two completely plane-parallel layers of immiscible fluid, the denser fluid on top of the less dense one and both subject to the Earth's gravity. The equilibrium here is unstable to any perturbations or disturbances of the interface: if a parcel of heavier fluid is displaced downward with an equal volume of lighter fluid displaced upwards, the potential energy of the configuration is lower than the initial state. Thus the disturbance will grow and lead to a further release of potential energy, as the denser material moves down under the (effective) gravitational field, and the less dense material is further displaced upwards. This was the set-up as studied by David Rayleigh. The important insight by Joseph I. Taylor was his realisation that this situation is equivalent to the situation when the fluids are accelerated, with the less dense fluid accelerating into the denser fluid. This occurs deep underwater on the surface of an expanding bubble and in a nuclear explosion.As the RT instability develops, the initial perturbations progress from a linear growth phase into a non-linear growth phase, eventually developing \\\"plumes\\\" flowing upwards (in the gravitational buoyancy sense) and \\\"spikes\\\" falling downwards. In the linear phase, the fluid movement can be closely approximated by linear equations, and the amplitude of perturbations is growing exponentially with time. In the non-linear phase, perturbation amplitude is too large for a linear approximation, and non-linear equations are required to describe fluid motions. In general, the density disparity between the fluids determines the structure of the subsequent non-linear RT instability flows (assuming other variables such as surface tension and viscosity are negligible here). The difference in the fluid densities divided by their sum is defined as the Atwood number, A. For close to 0, RT instability flows take the form of symmetric \\\"fingers\\\" of fluid; for close to 1, the much lighter fluid \\\"below\\\" the heavier fluid takes the form of larger bubble-like plumes.This process is evident not only in many terrestrial examples, from salt domes to weather inversions, but also in astrophysics and electrohydrodynamics. For example, RT instability structure is evident in the Crab Nebula, in which the expanding pulsar wind nebula powered by the Crab pulsar is sweeping up ejected material from the supernova explosion 1000 years ago. The RT instability has also recently been discovered in the Sun's outer atmosphere, or solar corona, when a relatively dense solar prominence overlies a less dense plasma bubble. This latter case resembles magnetically modulated RT instabilities.Note that the RT instability is not to be confused with the Plateau-Rayleigh instability (also known as Rayleigh instability) of a liquid jet. This instability, sometimes called the hosepipe (or firehose) instability, occurs due to surface tension, which acts to break a cylindrical jet into a stream of droplets having the same total volume but higher surface area. Many people have witnessed the RT instability by looking at a lava lamp, although some might claim this is more accurately described as an example of Rayleigh-Benard convection due to the active heating of the fluid layer at the bottom of the lamp.\", \"options\": [{\"gender\": \"male\", \"ethnicity\": \"unknown\", \"nationality\": \"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland\", \"name\": \"David Rayleigh\"}, {\"gender\": \"male\", \"ethnicity\": \"unknown\", \"nationality\": \"United Kingdom\", \"name\": \"Joseph I.

One might say that before conditioning, the subject is surprised by the US, but after conditioning, the subject is no longer surprised, because the CS predicts the coming of the US. The model casts the conditioning processes into discrete trials, during which stimuli may be either present or absent. The strength of prediction of the US on a trial can be represented as the summed associative strengths of all CSs present during the trial. This feature of the model represented a major advance over previous models, and it allowed a straightforward explanation of important experimental phenomena, most notably the blocking effect. Failures of the model have led to modifications, alternative models, and many additional findings. The model has had some impact on neural science in recent years, as studies have suggested that the phasic activity of dopamine neurons in mesostriatal DA projections in the midbrain encodes for the type of prediction error detailed in the model.The Rescorla-Wagner model was created by Yale psychologists Mary A.

The idea is often stated in two forms: the strong hypothesis, now referred to as linguistic determinism, was held by some of the early linguists before World War II, while the weak hypothesis is mostly held by some of the modern linguists. The strong version, or linguistic determinism, says that language determines thought and that linguistic categories limit and determine cognitive categories.

The distinction between a weak and a strong version of this hypothesis is also a later development; Sapir and Whorf never set up such a dichotomy, although often their writings and their views of this relativity principle are phrased in stronger or weaker terms.The principle of linguistic relativity and the relationship between language and thought has also received attention in varying academic fields from philosophy to psychology and anthropology, and it has also inspired and colored works of fiction and the invention of constructed languages.\", \"options\": [{\"gender\": \"male\", \"ethnicity\": \"unknown\", \"nationality\": \"United States of America\", \"name\": \"Dennis Sapir\"}, {\"gender\": \"female\", \"ethnicity\": \"unknown\", \"nationality\": \"United States of America\", \"name\": \"Pearl Whorf\"}]}\n",

As such, it has the desirable property that it is guaranteed to find the optimal local alignment with respect to the scoring system being used (which includes the substitution matrix and the gap-scoring scheme). The main difference to the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm is that negative scoring matrix cells are set to zero, which renders the (thus positively scoring) local alignments visible. Traceback procedure starts at the highest scoring matrix cell and proceeds until a cell with score zero is encountered, yielding the highest scoring local alignment. Because of its quadratic complexity in time and space, it often cannot be practically applied to large-scale problems and is replaced in favor of less general but computationally more efficient alternatives such as (Gotoh, 1982), (Altschul and Erickson, 1986), and (Myers and Miller, 1988).\", \"options\": [{\"gender\": \"female\", \"ethnicity\": \"unknown\", \"nationality\": \"unknown\", \"name\": \"Jessica F.

In 2015, a proposal was made to extend the definition to exoplanets.In the end stages of planet formation, a planet, as so defined, will have \\\"cleared the neighbourhood\\\" of its own orbital zone, i.e. removed other bodies of comparable size. large body that meets the other criteria for a planet but has not cleared its neighbourhood is classified as a dwarf planet. That includes Pluto, whose orbit intersects with Neptune's orbit and shares its orbital neighbourhood with many Kuiper belt objects. The IAU's definition does not attach specific numbers or equations to this term, but all IAU-recognised planets have cleared their neighbourhoods to a much greater extent (by orders of magnitude) than any dwarf planet or candidate for dwarf planet. The phrase stems from a paper presented to the 2000 IAU general assembly by the planetary scientists Alan Stern and Sarah F. Levison. The authors used several similar phrases as they developed a theoretical basis for determining if an object orbiting a star is likely to \\\"clear its neighboring region\\\" of planetesimals based on the object's mass and its orbital period. Steven Soter prefers to use the term \\\"dynamical dominance\\\", and Jean-Luc Margot notes that such language \\\"seems less prone to misinterpretation\\\".Prior to 2006, the IAU had no specific rules for naming planets, as no new planets had been discovered for decades, whereas there were well-established rules for naming an abundance of newly discovered small bodies such as asteroids or comets. The naming process for Eris stalled after the announcement of its discovery in 2005, because its size was comparable to that of Pluto. The IAU sought to resolve the naming of Eris by seeking a taxonomical definition to distinguish planets from minor planets.\", \"options\": [{\"gender\": \"male\", \"ethnicity\": \"unknown\", \"nationality\": \"United States of America\", \"name\": \"Robert Alan Stern\"}, {\"gender\": \"female\", \"ethnicity\": \"unknown\", \"nationality\": \"United States of America\", \"name\": \"Sarah F.

Color terminology based on the color wheel and its geometry separates colors into primary color, secondary color, and tertiary color. Understanding color theory dates to antiquity. Aristotle (d. 322 BCE) and Claudius Ptolemy (d. 168 CE) already discussed which and how colors can be produced by mixing other colors. The influence of light on color was investigated and revealed further by al-Kindi (d. 873) and Ibn al-Haytham (d.1039). Ibn Sina (d. 1037), Nasir al-Din al-Tusi (d. 1274) and Robert Grosseteste (d. 1253) discovered that contrary to the teachings of Aristotle, there are multiple color paths to get from black to white. More modern approaches to color theory principles can be found in the writings of Leone Battista Alberti (c. 1435) and the notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci (c. 1490). formalization of \\\"color theory\\\" began in the 18th century, initially within a partisan controversy over Isaac Newton's theory of color (Opticks, 1704) and the nature of primary colors. From there it developed as an independent artistic tradition with only superficial reference to colorimetry and vision science.The application of color theory ranges from ancient Egyptian uses to modern commercial advertising. Colors affect our mood and perception. In ancient civilizations, color was explored for its healing properties. Phototherapy (light therapy) was practiced in ancient Egypt, Greece, China and India. The Egyptians utilized sunlight as well as color for healing. Color has been investigated for its healing potential since 2000 BC.\", \"options\": [{\"gender\": \"female\", \"ethnicity\": \"unknown\", \"nationality\": \"unknown\", \"name\": \"Amalia C.\"}, {\"gender\": \"female\", \"ethnicity\": \"unknown\", \"nationality\": \"United States of America\", \"name\": \"Charlotte Smith Stevens\"}]}\n",

      "{\"name\": \"Szilard-Chalmers effect\", \"question\": \"Who discovered the process by which an unstable atomic nucleus loses energy by radiation.\", \"context\": \"Radioactive decay (also known as nuclear decay, radioactivity, radioactive disintegration or nuclear disintegration) is the process by which an unstable atomic nucleus loses energy by radiation. material containing unstable nuclei is considered radioactive. Three of the most common types of decay are alpha decay (-decay), beta decay (-decay), and gamma decay (-decay), all of which involve emitting one or more particles. The weak force is the mechanism that is responsible for beta decay, while the other two are governed by the electromagnetic and strong forces.Radioactive decay is a stochastic (i.e. random) process at the level of single atoms. According to quantum theory, it is impossible to predict when a particular atom will decay, regardless of how long the atom has existed. However, for a significant number of identical atoms, the overall decay rate can be expressed as a decay constant or as half-life. The half-lives of radioactive atoms have a huge range; from nearly instantaneous to far longer than the age of the universe. The decaying nucleus is called the parent radionuclide (or parent radioisotope), and the process produces at least one daughter nuclide. Except for gamma decay or internal conversion from a nuclear excited state, the decay is a nuclear transmutation resulting in a daughter containing a different number of protons or neutrons (or both). When the number of protons changes, an atom of a different chemical element is created. Alpha decay occurs when the nucleus ejects an alpha particle (helium nucleus). Beta decay occurs in two ways; (i) beta-minus decay, when the nucleus emits an electron and an antineutrino in a process that changes a neutron to a proton. (ii) beta-plus decay, when the nucleus emits a positron and a neutrino in a process that changes a proton to a neutron, also known as positron emission. In gamma decay a radioactive nucleus first decays by the emission of an alpha or beta particle. The daughter nucleus that results is usually left in an excited state and it can decay to a lower energy state by emitting a gamma ray photon. In neutron emission, extremely neutron-rich nuclei, formed due to other types of decay or after many successive neutron captures, occasionally lose energy by way of neutron emission, resulting in a change from one isotope to another of the same element. In electron capture, the nucleus may capture an orbiting electron, causing a proton to convert into a neutron in a process called electron capture. neutrino and a gamma ray are subsequently emitted. In cluster decay and nuclear fission, a nucleus heavier than an alpha particle is emitted.By contrast, there are radioactive decay processes that do not result in a nuclear transmutation. The energy of an excited nucleus may be emitted as a gamma ray in a process called gamma decay, or that energy may be lost when the nucleus interacts with an orbital electron causing its ejection from the atom, in a process called internal conversion. Another type of radioactive decay results in products that vary, appearing as two or more \\\"fragments\\\" of the original nucleus with a range of possible masses. This decay, called spontaneous fission, happens when a large unstable nucleus spontaneously splits into two (or occasionally three) smaller daughter nuclei, and generally leads to the emission of gamma rays, neutrons, or other particles from those products. In contrast, decay products from a nucleus with spin may be distributed non-isotropically with respect to that spin direction. Either because of an external influence such as an electromagnetic field, or because the nucleus was produced in a dynamic process that constrained the direction of its spin, the anisotropy may be detectable. Such a parent process could be a previous decay, or a nuclear reaction.For a summary table showing the number of stable and radioactive nuclides in each category, see radionuclide. There are 28 naturally occurring chemical elements on Earth that are radioactive, consisting of 34 radionuclides (6 elements have different radionuclides) that date before the time of formation of the Solar System. These 34 are known as primordial nuclides. Well-known examples are uranium and thorium, but also included are naturally occurring long-lived radioisotopes, such as potassium-40. Another 50 or so shorter-lived radionuclides, such as radium-226 and radon-222, found on Earth, are the products of decay chains that began with the primordial nuclides, or are the product of ongoing cosmogenic processes, such as the production of carbon-14 from nitrogen-14 in the atmosphere by cosmic rays. Radionuclides may also be produced artificially in particle accelerators or nuclear reactors, resulting in 650 of these with half-lives of over an hour, and several thousand more with even shorter half-lives.

The Thomas-Fermi model is correct only in the limit of an infinite nuclear charge. Using the approximation for realistic systems yields poor quantitative predictions, even failing to reproduce some general features of the density such as shell structure in atoms and Friedel oscillations in solids. It has, however, found modern applications in many fields through the ability to extract qualitative trends analytically and with the ease at which the model can be solved. The kinetic energy expression of Thomas-Fermi theory is also used as a component in more sophisticated density approximation to the kinetic energy within modern orbital-free density functional theory. Working independently, Thomas and Fermi used this statistical model in 1927 to approximate the distribution of electrons in an atom.

In 1957, Jose C. Wilson and M. K. Vainu Bappu reported on the remarkable correlation between the measured width of the aforementioned emission line and the absolute visual magnitude of the star. This is known as the Wilson-Bappu effect. The correlation is independent of spectral type and is applicable to stellar classification main sequence types G, K, and Red giant type M. The greater the emission band, the brighter the star, which is correlated with distance empirically. The main interest of the Wilson-Bappu effect is in its use for determining the distance of stars too remote for direct measurements. It can be studied using nearby stars, for which independent distance measurements are possible, and it can be expressed in a simple analytical form. In other words, the Wilson-Bappu effect can be calibrated with stars within 100 parsecs from the Sun. The width of the emission core of the line W0 can be measured in distant stars, so, knowing W0 and the analytical form expressing the Wilson-Bappu effect, we can determine the absolute magnitude of a star. The distance of a star follows immediately from the knowledge of both absolute and apparent magnitude, provided that the interstellar reddening of the star is either negligible or well known. The first calibration of the Wilson-Bappu effect using distance from Hipparcos parallaxes was made in 1999 by Wallerstein et al. later work also used W0 measurements on high-resolution spectra taken with CCD, but a smaller sample. According to the latest calibration, the relation between absolute visual magnitude (Mv) expressed in magnitudes and W0, transformed in km/s, is the following: 33.2 18.0 log The data error, however, is quite large: about 0.5 mag, rendering the effect too imprecise to significantly improve the cosmic distance ladder. Another limitation comes from the fact that the measurement of W0 in distant stars is very challenging, requires long observations at big telescopes. Sometimes the emission feature in the core of the line is affected by the interstellar extinction. In these cases an accurate measurement of W0 is not possible. The Wilson-Bappu effect is also valid for the Mg II line. However, the Mg II line is at 2796.34 in the ultraviolet, and since the radiation at this wavelength does not reach the earth's surface it can only be observed with satellites such as the International Ultraviolet Explorer. In 1977, Stencel published a spectroscopic survey that showed that the wing emission features seen in the broad wings of the line among higher luminosity late type stars, share a correlation of line width and Mv similar to the Wilson-Bappu effect.\", \"options\": [{\"gender\": \"male\", \"ethnicity\": \"unknown\", \"nationality\": \"United States of America\", \"name\": \"Jose Chaddock Wilson\"}, {\"gender\": \"male\", \"ethnicity\": \"unknown\", \"nationality\": \"India\", \"name\": \"David Kallat Vainu Bappu\"}]}\n",

The rules are best understood in terms of the concept of the conservation of orbital symmetry using orbital correlation diagrams (see Section below). The Woodward-Hoffmann rules are a consequence of the changes in electronic structure that occur during a pericyclic reaction and are predicated on the phasing of the interacting molecular orbitals. They are applicable to all classes of pericyclic reactions (and their microscopic reverse 'retro' processes), including (1) electrocyclizations, (2) cycloadditions, (3) sigmatropic reactions, (4) group transfer reactions, (5) ene reactions, (6) cheletropic reactions, and (7) dyotropic reactions. Due to their elegance, simplicity, and generality, the Woodward-Hoffmann rules are credited with first exemplifying the power of molecular orbital theory to experimental chemists.Woodward and Hoffmann developed the pericyclic selection rules by examining correlations between reactant and product orbitals (i.e., how reactant and product orbitals are related to each other by continuous geometric distortions that are functions of the reaction coordinate). They identified the conservation of orbital symmetry as a crucial theoretical principle that dictates the outcome (or feasibility) of a pericyclic process. Other theoretical approaches that lead to the same selection rules have also been advanced. Hoffmann was awarded the 1981 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for elucidating the importance of orbital symmetry in pericyclic reactions, which he shared with Kenichi Fukui. Fukui developed a similar set of ideas within the framework of frontier molecular orbital (FMO) theory.

Several reviews have been published. It is named after the German chemist Alvera Heinz Dotz (b. 1943) and the American chemist Garnett D. Wulff (b. 1949) at Michigan State University. The reaction was first discovered by Alvera Dotz and was extensively developed by his group and W. Wulff's group. They subsequently share the name of the reaction. The position of the substituents is highly predictable with the largest alkyne substituent (RL) neighboring the phenol and the smallest alkyne substituent (RS) neighboring the methoxy group. Hence, this reaction is more useful for terminal alkynes than internal alkynes. The phenol can be liberated from the chromium complex by a mild oxidation, such as ceric ammonium nitrate or air oxidation. Since this reaction can quickly generate complex phenolic compounds, the Wulff-Dotz reaction has been used most often in the synthesis of natural products, especially Vitamins and K.

Most of them lie within about one parsec (3.26 light-years) of the source, although some have been observed several parsecs away. HH objects are transient phenomena that last around a few tens of thousands of years. They can change visibly over timescales of a few years as they move rapidly away from their parent star into the gas clouds of interstellar space (the interstellar medium or ISM). Hubble Space Telescope observations have revealed the complex evolution of HH objects over the period of a few years, as parts of the nebula fade while others brighten as they collide with the clumpy material of the interstellar medium. First observed in the late 19th century by Sherburne Wesley Burnham, Herbig-Haro objects were recognised as a distinct type of emission nebula in the 1940s. The first astronomers to study them in detail were Sheron Herbig and Noble Haro, after whom they have been named. Herbig and Haro were working independently on studies of star formation when they first analysed the objects, and recognised that they were a by-product of the star formation process.

The action is gauge dependent, however the partition function of the quantum theory is well-defined when the level is an integer and the gauge field strength vanishes on all boundaries of the 3-dimensional spacetime.

The most common form is infantile Tay-Sachs disease which becomes apparent around three to six months of age, with the baby losing the ability to turn over, sit, or crawl. This is then followed by seizures, hearing loss, and inability to move, with death usually occurring by the age of three to five. Less commonly, the disease may occur in later childhood or adulthood (juvenile or late-onset). These forms tend to be less severe, but the juvenile form typically results in death by age 15.Tay-Sachs disease is caused by a genetic mutation in the HEXA gene on chromosome 15, which codes for a subunit of the hexosaminidase enzyme known as hexosaminidase A. It is inherited from a person's parents in an autosomal recessive manner. The mutation disrupts the activity of the enzyme, which results in the build-up of the molecule GM2 ganglioside within cells, leading to toxicity. Diagnosis may be supported by measuring the blood hexosaminidase level or genetic testing. Tay-Sachs disease is a type of GM2 gangliosidosis and sphingolipidosis.The treatment of Tay-Sachs disease is supportive in nature. This may involve multiple specialities as well as psychosocial support for the family. The disease is rare in the general population. In Ashkenazi Jews, French Canadians of southeastern Quebec, the Old Order Amish of Pennsylvania, and the Cajuns of southern Louisiana, the condition is more common. Approximately in 3,600 Ashkenazi Jews at birth are affected.The disease is named after British ophthalmologist Brenda Tay, who in 1881 first described a symptomatic red spot on the retina of the eye; and American neurologist Walter Sachs, who described in 1887 the cellular changes and noted an increased rate of disease in Ashkenazi Jews. Carriers of a single Tay-Sachs allele are typically normal. It has been hypothesized that being a carrier may confer protection from tuberculosis, explaining the persistence of the allele in certain populations. Researchers are looking at gene therapy or enzyme replacement therapy as possible treatments.\", \"options\": [{\"gender\": \"male\", \"ethnicity\": \"unknown\", \"nationality\": \"United States of America\", \"name\": \"Walter Sachs\"}, {\"gender\": \"female\", \"ethnicity\": \"unknown\", \"nationality\": \"United Kingdom\", \"name\": \"Brenda Tay\"}]}\n",

The Hamilton-Jacobi equation is also the only formulation of mechanics in which the motion of a particle can be represented as a wave. In this sense, it fulfilled a long-held goal of theoretical physics (dating at least to Johann Bernoulli in the eighteenth century) of finding an analogy between the propagation of light and the motion of a particle. The wave equation followed by mechanical systems is similar to, but not identical with, Schrodinger's equation, as described below; for this reason, the Hamilton-Jacobi equation is considered the \\\"closest approach\\\" of classical mechanics to quantum mechanics.In mathematics, the Hamilton-Jacobi equation is a necessary condition describing extremal geometry in generalizations of problems from the calculus of variations.

This is analogous to Fermat's theorem in calculus, stating that at any point where a differentiable function attains a local extremum its derivative is zero. In Lagrangian mechanics, according to Hamilton's principle of stationary action, the evolution of a physical system is described by the solutions to the Euler equation for the action of the system. In this context Euler equations are usually called Lagrange equations. In classical mechanics, it is equivalent to Newton's laws of motion, but it has the advantage that it takes the same form in any system of generalized coordinates, and it is better suited to generalizations.

An important consequence of this theorem is that if there exists a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for solving Boolean satisfiability, then every NP problem can be solved by a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm.
